Implementing a changelog: 

It's a file that has a list of changes made to a project, usually in date order. The typical breakdown is to separate a list of versions, and then within each version, show:

    Added features
    Modified/Improved features
    Deleted features

Branch workflow types 
    
    centralised, distributed workflow

Stages of Git
    
    Repo - history, Stage - index, Working directory
