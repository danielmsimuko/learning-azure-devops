Implementing a changelog: 

It's a file that has a list of changes made to a project, usually in date order. The typical breakdown is to separate a list of versions, and then within each version, show:

    Added features
    Modified/Improved features
    Deleted features

Branch workflow types 
    
    centralised
        its beneficial to use when you have large code bases
        specify fine grain permissions at the file level 
        monitor usage of files becuase the checkin and check out process happens over the server 
        lock files so they cannot be accessed on the server
    
    distributed
        giving the developer full control over the repository by allowing local copies 
        full history along with the repository code 
        good for many distributed teams
        good for working alongside open source code bases
